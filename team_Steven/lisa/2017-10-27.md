Hi Ganesh,
        Eunice and I will contine test Part 1 -API in testslink during your guys holiday, there are some issues need your help.
     1--> WSS-CORE-Call Detail Records,  do we test with APP or API, could you give some example?
     2--> WSS-Management Console, do we test with WCAS MangementConsole?
     3--> WCAS-SIP-AS-API PNAG, do we test with APP or API , could you give some example?  and what's the FT(case number: MINE Ph1-12455)?
                                                      
       FOR 1 and 3, if we test with APP, should be tested on android and ios ?
